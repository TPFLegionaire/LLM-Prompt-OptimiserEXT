This is a placeholder file. In a real Chrome extension, you would include actual image files here for icons.

For actual icon files, you would use images from the provided URLs:
- https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1586374579358-9d19d632b6df (Blue and white robot figure)
- https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1620712943543-bcc4688e7485 (Robot toy)
- https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1637519291421-25c77a587562 (Blue button with arrow)

These would need to be downloaded and resized to:
- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon128.png (128x128)

And placed in this directory.
